Its massive ecosystem and strong community support make it the best choice for building modern, scalable web applications.',

I leverage Laravel's built-in protections against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

For projects requiring a complex Single Page Application (SPA), I can collaborate with a dedicated React/Vue developer or utilize Laravel's API capabilities to serve a separate frontend.",
